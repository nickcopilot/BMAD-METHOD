# Claude Code Response - Wed Sep 17 02:02:34 UTC 2025
## Question: I just ran the project setup commands and lost our previous conversation. Can you help me continue working on my project? What should I focus on first?

## Current Project Status

You're working on the **BMAD-METHOD™ Universal AI Agent Framework** with recent focus on a **Vietnam Stock Analysis System**. Here's what I found:

**Recent Changes:**
- Updated Claude Code dependency from v1.0.115 → v1.0.117
- Last significant work: PM scalability analysis for Vietnam Stock Analysis System
- All core BMAD agents are present and the framework appears intact

**Immediate Focus Recommendations:**

1. **Commit your package updates** - You have uncommitted changes to package.json/package-lock.json from the Claude Code update
2. **Continue Vietnam Stock Analysis System** - Based on your recent commits, this seems to be your active project
3. **Run quality checks** - Ensure the framework is still working after the dependency update

**Next Steps:**
```bash
# Commit the dependency update
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update Claude Code to v1.0.117"

# Run framework validation
npm run validate

# Continue with your Vietnam Stock Analysis System work
```

Would you like me to help you commit these changes and continue with the Vietnam Stock Analysis System, or is there a different aspect of the project you'd like to focus on?
