# Claude Code Response - Wed Sep 17 02:09:02 UTC 2025
## Question: What should I work on today based on my project's current state?

Based on your project's current state, here's what you should work on today:

## Immediate Priority: Commit Your Progress

You have uncommitted changes from updating the Claude Code dependency (1.0.115 â†’ 1.0.117). You should:

1. **Commit the dependency update**: `git add package.json package-lock.json && git commit -m "Update @anthropic-ai/claude-code to 1.0.117"`

## Today's Focus Areas:

### 1. **Quality Assurance** (Highest Priority)
Run the pre-release checks to ensure everything is working:
```bash
npm run pre-release  # Runs validate + format:check + lint
```

### 2. **Build Verification** 
Test the build system with the updated Claude Code dependency:
```bash
npm run build        # Build all agent bundles
npm run validate     # Validate agent definitions
```

### 3. **Project Health Check**
Your recent commits show some instability ("lost our..." suggests interrupted work). Consider:
- Review what was interrupted in the previous session
- Ensure all agent dependencies are properly resolved
- Check if any documentation needs updating

### 4. **Development Workflow Optimization**
Given this is an AI agent framework, you might want to:
- Test the agent build system with the new Claude Code version
- Verify agent team configurations are working correctly
- Review the Vietnam Stock Analysis System work mentioned in recent commits

The most critical task is getting your current changes committed and ensuring the updated dependency doesn't break anything in your build system.
