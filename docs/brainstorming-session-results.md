- Dynamic stock categorization (investing vs trading modes)
- Signal strength scoring system (1-12 scale)

## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking - 20 minutes
**Description:** Breaking down fundamental factors that determine good stock investments

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Institutional buying patterns as primary indicator
2. Quick drops from highs with strong pull potential
3. Smart money cash flow detection capabilities
4. 2-3 day leading indicators before major moves
5. Volume and momentum detection over traditional fundamentals

**Insights Discovered:**
- User prioritizes flow and momentum over traditional fundamental analysis
- Smart money tracking is core to investment decision making
- Early warning signals more valuable than lagging indicators

**Notable Connections:**
- VSA and Wyckoff methods align perfectly with smart money detection philosophy
- Vietnam market patterns require specific adaptations

### Analogical Thinking - 15 minutes
**Description:** Using restaurant analogies to understand different stock personalities

**Ideas Generated:**
1. VIX/GEX = Trendy nightclub with aggressive market makers
2. MSN/MBB = Established fine dining with loyal long-term customers
3. Securities firms = Fast-casual chains with high turnover
4. Infrastructure stocks = Family restaurants with steady regulars

**Insights Discovered:**
- Different stocks require different analytical approaches
- Market maker behavior varies significantly by stock type
- Investment horizon should match stock "personality"

**Notable Connections:**
- Stock personality determines optimal analysis method
- Detection criteria must adapt to stock characteristics

### Mind Mapping - 25 minutes
**Description:** Organizing dual-mode framework concepts systematically

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Investing Mode (≥3 months): MBB, MSN types with stable growth
2. Trading Mode (1-2 weeks): CII, VDS, VIC, GEX, DXG, DIG, SHS with strong movements
3. Wyckoff cycle mapping: Accumulation → Markup → Distribution → Markdown
4. VSA signal integration: No Demand, No Supply, Stopping Volume, Effort vs Result
5. Vietnamese stock categorization with specific examples

**Insights Discovered:**
- Time horizon determines analysis approach, not stock type
- Same stock can be both investing and trading candidate depending on timeframe
- Wyckoff and VSA complement each other perfectly

**Notable Connections:**
- Daily charts for all trading signals
- Weekly/3-day charts for all investing signals
- Smart money footprints vary by stock category

### "Yes, And" Building - 15 minutes
**Description:** Collaborative refinement of dynamic classification system

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Dynamic stock classification based on current market phase
2. VIC example: investing during accumulation, trading during markup breakouts
3. Multi-timeframe signal alignment as highest conviction indicator
4. Vietnamese market context integration requirements

**Insights Discovered:**
- Stocks should dynamically switch between investment approaches
- Timeframe alignment creates highest probability setups
- Market-specific factors require systematic integration

**Notable Connections:**
- Dynamic classification increases system sophistication
- Context-aware signals improve accuracy significantly

### Morphological Analysis - 20 minutes
**Description:** Systematic parameter combination for optimal signal generation

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Signal strength hierarchy with specific rankings
2. Vietnamese market holiday and volume considerations
3. News event integration and override mechanisms
4. Complete 1-12 scale scoring system with modifiers

**Insights Discovered:**
- Parameter combinations have clear probability rankings
- Vietnamese market factors significantly impact signal reliability
- Scoring systems enable automated prioritization

**Notable Connections:**
- Market context modifiers prevent false signals
- Systematic scoring replaces subjective decision making
