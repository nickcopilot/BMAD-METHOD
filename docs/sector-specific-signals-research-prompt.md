# Deep Research Prompt: Sector-Specific VSA/Wyckoff Signal Analysis for Vietnam Stock Market

## Research Objective

**Primary Goal**: Validate and refine sector-specific VSA/Wyckoff signal detection parameters for Vietnam's four key stock sectors (Banking, Real Estate, Securities, Steel/Materials) to create precise, automated smart money detection algorithms.

**Key Decisions This Will Inform**:
- Sector-specific volume and spread thresholds for signal reliability
- Context-dependent interpretation rules for identical VSA patterns
- Optimal confirmation requirements per sector characteristics
- Risk management parameters tailored to sector volatility patterns

## Background Context

Based on comprehensive EIC Framework brainstorming session results and expert sector analysis, we have identified that Vietnamese stock sectors exhibit distinct smart money patterns due to:

- **Banking**: Heavy state ownership, regulatory sensitivity, policy-driven institutional flows
- **Real Estate**: Long project cycles, land acquisition catalysts, institutional accumulation patterns
- **Securities**: Direct correlation with market turnover, revenue-driven volume patterns
- **Steel/Materials**: Commodity price sensitivity, infrastructure announcement impacts

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions (Must Answer)

1. **Banking Signal Validation (VCB, BID, CTG)**:
   - Do the proposed thresholds (Stopping Volume ≥2.5× 20-day avg, close >midpoint) accurately identify institutional absorption during policy events?
   - How reliable is the 3-bar confirmation requirement for avoiding false signals?
   - What percentage of SBV policy announcements create tradeable VSA patterns within ±5 days?

2. **Real Estate Accumulation Patterns (VHM, VIC, NVL)**:
   - How frequently do 6+ week accumulation ranges precede major project announcements?
   - What is the success rate of Spring patterns (temporary below-range breaks) in real estate stocks?
   - Do presale announcements consistently generate SOS breakouts with 1.8× volume thresholds?

3. **Securities Firm Volume Dynamics (SSI, VCI, VND)**:
   - How does the correlation between broker stock volume and VN-Index ADTV affect signal interpretation?
   - When does "Effort vs Result" indicate distribution vs normal revenue-driven trading?
   - What confirmation methods distinguish revenue-positive volume spikes from distribution patterns?

4. **Steel/Materials Commodity Sensitivity (HPG, HSG)**:
   - How quickly do VSA patterns respond to global iron ore/scrap price changes?
   - What percentage of infrastructure project announcements generate sustained markup patterns?
   - How effective are upthrust patterns in identifying false breakouts during export/tariff speculation?

### Secondary Questions (Nice to Have)

5. **Cross-Sector Smart Money Rotation**:
   - What VSA signatures indicate institutional money moving between sectors?
   - Do sector rotation patterns follow predictable sequences during economic cycles?

6. **Market Cap and Liquidity Effects**:
   - How do signal thresholds need adjustment for different market capitalizations within sectors?
   - What volume normalization methods work best for stocks with varying daily turnover?

7. **News Integration Optimization**:
   - What news sources and keywords provide the most reliable context for signal interpretation?
   - How can automated news scanning be integrated with real-time VSA pattern detection?

## Research Methodology
