## Feature 5A.1: SLA Dashboard and Tracking ✅ CORE IMPLEMENTATION

### User Story
**As** any user (auditor, supervisor, leadership)
**I want** to see SLA performance in a traffic-light dashboard
**So that** I can quickly identify at-risk tasks and projects

### Implementation Details
- [ ] **Traffic-light SLA visualization**:
  - 🟢 Green: On track (>20% SLA time remaining)
  - 🟡 Yellow: At risk (5-20% SLA time remaining)

- [ ] **Individual task SLA status**:
  - Countdown timers with hours/days remaining
  - Visual progress bars showing SLA consumption
  - Clear overdue indicators
- [ ] **Basic SLA performance aggregation**:
  - User-level SLA compliance rate
  - Team-level SLA summary
  - Simple percentage calculations

### Deferred to Phase 1B
- ⏭️ **Historical SLA trend analysis** and reporting
- ⏭️ **Advanced SLA threshold configuration** by task type
- ⏭️ **Predictive SLA risk modeling**
- ⏭️ **Cross-departmental SLA comparison analytics**

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **SLA status display** shows accurate time remaining for all active tasks
- [ ] **Color coding** consistently applied across all interfaces (Kanban, Calendar, Dashboard)
- [ ] **Countdown timers** update in real-time with accurate calculations

## Feature 5A.2: Basic SLA Alerting ✅ ESSENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION

### User Story
**As** a supervisor or auditor
**I want** to receive alerts before SLA breaches occur
**So that** I can take preventive action

### Implementation Details
- [ ] **Basic alert thresholds**:
  - Yellow alert: 24 hours before SLA deadline
  - Red alert: 4 hours before SLA deadline
  - Critical alert: SLA breach occurred
- [ ] **Alert delivery channels**:
  - Email notifications (primary)
  - Dashboard notifications (secondary)
  - In-app notification badges
- [ ] **Alert recipients**:
  - Task assignee (always)
  - Direct supervisor (configurable)
  - Department head (for critical alerts only)

### Deferred to Phase 1B
- ⏭️ **Advanced escalation workflows** with multi-level routing
- ⏭️ **SMS alerts** for critical breaches
- ⏭️ **Configurable alert thresholds** per task type/priority
- ⏭️ **SLA breach post-mortem** reporting

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Alert timing** triggers at configured thresholds accurately
- [ ] **Email notifications** delivered within 15 minutes of threshold breach
- [ ] **Dashboard alerts** appear immediately with clear messaging
- [ ] **Alert content** includes task details, urgency level, and recommended actions
- [ ] **Alert acknowledgment** system tracks notification delivery and reading
- [ ] **Alert suppression** prevents duplicate notifications for same incident

### Technical Requirements
- Background job scheduler for SLA monitoring
- Multi-channel notification service
- Alert template system with dynamic content
- Notification delivery tracking
- Alert deduplication logic

### Success Criteria
- 95% alert delivery success rate within 15 minutes
- Zero duplicate alerts for same SLA risk
- Clear, actionable alert content
- Reliable notification across all delivery channels

## SLA Calculation Logic

### Core SLA Formulas
```python
# SLA time remaining calculation
def calculate_sla_remaining(task):
    sla_deadline = task.planned_start_date + timedelta(hours=task.sla_target_hours)
    now = datetime.now()
    remaining = sla_deadline - now
    return max(0, remaining.total_seconds() / 3600)  # Hours remaining

# SLA status determination
def get_sla_status(hours_remaining, total_sla_hours):
    percentage_remaining = (hours_remaining / total_sla_hours) * 100
    if percentage_remaining > 20:
        return "green"
    elif percentage_remaining > 5:
        return "yellow"
    else:
        return "red"
```

### Alert Trigger Logic
```python
# Alert threshold checking
def should_trigger_alert(task, hours_remaining):
    if hours_remaining <= 0:
        return "critical"  # SLA breach
    elif hours_remaining <= 4:
        return "red"      # 4 hours before breach
    elif hours_remaining <= 24:
        return "yellow"   # 24 hours before breach
    return None
```

## Database Schema (Phase 1A)

### SLA Tracking Tables
```sql
-- SLA alert configuration
CREATE TABLE sla_alert_config (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    alert_level VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'yellow', 'red', 'critical'
    hours_before_breach INTEGER NOT NULL,
    notification_channels TEXT[], -- ['email', 'dashboard', 'sms']
    recipient_roles TEXT[], -- ['assignee', 'supervisor', 'department_head']
    active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    task_id UUID REFERENCES tasks(id),
    alert_level VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    hours_remaining DECIMAL(5,2),
    triggered_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    acknowledged_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    acknowledged_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    resolved_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- SLA performance snapshots
CREATE TABLE sla_performance (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    period_start DATE,
    period_end DATE,
    total_tasks INTEGER,
