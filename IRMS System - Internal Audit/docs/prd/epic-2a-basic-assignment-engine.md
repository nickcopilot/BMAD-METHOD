## Feature 2A.2: Workload Monitoring and Alerts ✅ CORE IMPLEMENTATION

### User Story
**As** a Department Head
**I want** to receive alerts when staff workloads approach capacity limits
**So that** I can prevent burnout and maintain quality

### Full Implementation (No deferrals)
- [ ] **Real-time workload calculation** based on:
  - Active task effort estimates
  - Current assignments and commitments
  - Planned vs actual time tracking
- [ ] **Three-tier alert system**:
  - Green: <80% capacity (optimal)
  - Yellow: 80-95% capacity (monitor)
  - Red: >95% capacity (immediate action)
- [ ] **Automated notifications**:
  - Email alerts for threshold breaches
  - Dashboard alerts with visual indicators
  - Weekly workload summary reports
- [ ] **Current workload visualization**:
  - Individual workload charts
  - Team workload distribution
  - Department capacity overview

### Deferred to Phase 1B
- ⏭️ Historical workload trending and analysis
- ⏭️ Qualitative workload assessment integration
- ⏭️ Predictive capacity planning algorithms
- ⏭️ Advanced workload balancing recommendations

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Workload calculation** accurately reflects current task load
- [ ] **Alert thresholds** trigger appropriate notifications at configured levels
- [ ] **Visual indicators** clearly display workload status across interfaces
- [ ] **Email notifications** delivered within 15 minutes of threshold breach
- [ ] **Dashboard integration** shows workload status in relevant views
- [ ] **Manual workload adjustments** possible for exceptional circumstances

### Technical Requirements
- Real-time workload calculation service
- Configurable threshold management system
- Multi-channel notification service (email, dashboard, SMS)
- Workload visualization components
- Background job for workload monitoring and alerting

### Success Criteria
- Accurate workload calculations within 5% variance
- Timely alert notifications (15-minute SLA)
- Clear visual workload indicators
- 95% alert accuracy (no false positives/negatives)

## Integration Points

### Database Schema Requirements
```sql
-- Assignment tracking
CREATE TABLE assignments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    task_id UUID REFERENCES tasks(id),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    assigned_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    score DECIMAL(5,2),
    reasoning JSONB,
    status assignment_status,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Workload monitoring
CREATE TABLE workload_snapshots (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    calculated_load DECIMAL(5,2),
    capacity_percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
    alert_level workload_alert_level,
    snapshot_time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
