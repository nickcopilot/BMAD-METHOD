- [ ] **Planned vs actual visualization**:
  - Planned start/end dates shown
  - Actual dates overlaid for comparison
  - Visual indicators for variance
- [ ] **Concurrent task overlap highlighting**:
  - Clear visual indication of scheduling conflicts
  - Automatic conflict detection and warnings
- [ ] **SLA deadline markers**:
  - Countdown timers with color coding
  - Escalating urgency indicators
- [ ] **Drag-and-drop rescheduling**:
  - Direct task movement between dates
  - Conflict warnings and resolution suggestions
  - Permission-based rescheduling controls

### Technical Requirements
- FullCalendar.js integration or similar calendar library
- Task overlap detection algorithms
- Real-time SLA calculation and display
- Conflict resolution engine
- Mobile calendar interactions

### Success Criteria
- Real-time conflict detection working
- Visual scheduling optimization functional
- Mobile-responsive calendar interface
- <500ms calendar rendering performance

## Feature 1.3: Basic Priority Engine ⚡ SIMPLIFIED IMPLEMENTATION

### User Story
**As** an auditor
**I want** the system to suggest task priority order
**So that** I can focus on the most impactful work

### Phase 1A Simplified Implementation
- [ ] **Basic priority calculation formula**:
  - Deadline urgency: 40% weight
  - SLA risk level: 35% weight
  - Task difficulty: 25% weight
- [ ] **Static priority scoring**: Recalculated daily (not real-time)
- [ ] **Priority score display**: Numerical score with basic reasoning
- [ ] **Manual priority override**: Supervisor capability to adjust priorities
- [ ] **Priority change notifications**: Basic email alerts for significant changes

### Deferred to Phase 1B
- ⏭️ Real-time dynamic recalculation
- ⏭️ KPI alignment factor (15% weight)
- ⏭️ Business impact scoring (20% weight)
- ⏭️ Advanced reasoning transparency

### Technical Requirements
- Priority calculation service with configurable weights
- Daily batch job for priority recalculation
- Priority scoring algorithm implementation
- Override tracking and audit trail
- Basic notification system

### Success Criteria
- Clear priority ranking for all tasks
- Transparent scoring rationale displayed
- Override functionality working for supervisors
- Consistent priority calculations across system

---

## Epic Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- User authentication system (OAuth2/JWT)
- Basic database schema (users, tasks, roles)
- Role-based access control framework
- Audit trail logging system

### Provides Foundation For
- Epic 2: Assignment Engine (requires task data)
