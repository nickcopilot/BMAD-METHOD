- [ ] **Audit trail** records all KPI calculations with timestamps
- [ ] **Error handling** for missing or invalid data
- [ ] **Performance optimization** completes calculations within time limits

### Technical Requirements
```python
# Basic KPI calculation service structure
class BasicKPICalculator:
    def calculate_completion_rate(self, user_id: UUID, period: date) -> float
    def calculate_training_hours(self, user_id: UUID, period: date) -> float
    def calculate_overall_score(self, effectiveness: float, development: float) -> float
