## ‚ö†Ô∏è AREAS FOR OPTIMIZATION

### **1. Signal Generation Frequency**
**Current State:** Only 2/6 stocks generated signals in 4-month period
**Analysis:** High-quality, conservative approach but may miss opportunities

**Recommendations:**
- **Lower Buy Threshold:** Reduce from 65 to 60 for more signal generation
- **Add "Weak Buy" Category:** 55-64 score range for lower-conviction signals
- **Sector-Specific Thresholds:** Different thresholds for different sectors

### **2. Multi-Sector Coverage**
**Current State:** Signals concentrated in Banking and Oil & Gas sectors
**Analysis:** Technology, Real Estate, Steel sectors not generating signals

**Recommendations:**
- **Sector-Specific Calibration:** Adjust thresholds per sector characteristics
- **Volatility-Adjusted Scoring:** Account for sector-specific volatility patterns
- **Market Cap Considerations:** Large-cap vs mid-cap signal differentiation

### **3. Temporal Signal Distribution**
**Current State:** Signals clustered in July-August 2025 period
**Analysis:** May indicate seasonal or market-cycle dependency

**Recommendations:**
- **Seasonal Factor Expansion:** Add more Vietnamese market seasonal factors
- **Market Cycle Integration:** Consider broader market regime identification
- **Diversified Time Horizons:** Add short-term (5-10 day) and long-term (30+ day) signals

## üîß RECOMMENDED OPTIMIZATIONS

### **Phase 1: Threshold Optimization (Immediate)**

```python
# Current Thresholds
signal_threshold_buy = 65    # Too conservative
signal_threshold_sell = 35   # Appropriate

# Optimized Thresholds
signal_threshold_strong_buy = 70  # High conviction
signal_threshold_buy = 60         # Standard buy
signal_threshold_weak_buy = 55    # Lower conviction
signal_threshold_hold = 45        # Neutral
signal_threshold_sell = 35        # Current level appropriate
```

### **Phase 2: Sector-Specific Adjustments**

```python
sector_threshold_adjustments = {
    'Banks': 0.95,        # More conservative (already performing well)
    'Technology': 0.85,   # Less conservative (currently no signals)
    'Real_Estate': 0.80,  # Less conservative (cyclical opportunities)
    'Steel': 0.85,        # Industrial cyclical adjustment
    'Oil_Gas': 1.0,       # Keep current (performing well)
    'F&B': 0.90          # Consumer staples adjustment
}
```

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Vietnamese Context**

```python
enhanced_vn_factors = {
    'quarterly_earnings_season': 1.1,     # Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4 boost
    'dividend_ex_date_proximity': 1.05,   # Pre-dividend signals
    'foreign_ownership_limit_approach': 1.15,  # Near foreign limits
    'government_policy_announcements': 0.9,    # Policy uncertainty
    'vn_index_momentum_alignment': 1.1     # Market momentum sync
}
```
